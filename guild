Ziki like a distributed social network like facebook - the ui itself is the admin, there is no separate admin interface.

The platform owner, once logged in, can edit and view timeline. The users can only comment on that persons posts, they do not see how own timeline
Think of it like facebook - if you are looking at my profile, you do not see my timeline
I only see my own timeline when I am logged in on my own account.

if ziki is installed on markessien.com, going there you see my posts. If you want to comment, you log in to comment
if I log in, because it is my own site, I see a timeline of people I am following.
I can follow via RSS feed or I can follow any other ziki site.

The owner just has an additional link called Timeline. All the rest is the same, It's like your own personal facebook.

Owner need a place to manage who you are following.
when logged in owner can see Followers and Following page.

If disqus is being used, there is no need to login using ziki then login is reserved for site owner.


so think of it this way, instead of tweeting on twitter, you tweet on your own personal website. Others see it on their own timeline on their own person websites too.

you can choose to make your timeline visible or not, by default  it is visible, but you can hide it.
It should be accessible by owner clicking to see who a user follows.



Guest visits markessien.com and sees the posts that Mark Essien has been writing.
If he tries to comment, he gets a log in prompt
When mark essien visits markessien.com, and logs in, he sees a timeline of what he is following

each site only has one user: the owner of the site.

every other person is a guest, looking at what that person has been writing, just like  looking at someones blog

so if you want your own ziki site you visit hng.tech/ziki and download a copy of ziki and install on your own server.
